#PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a web-based application designed to provide a simple yet highly secure way to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256 encryption standard. With data security becoming a growing concern, this tool ensures that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access. By using AES-256, one of the most advanced and widely trusted encryption methods, users can securely store, share, and transfer their confidential files without worrying about data breaches. The tool is built using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, creating a seamless and interactive user experience.

This encryption tool features an intuitive and visually appealing interface with a cyberpunk-inspired design that includes glowing effects, animations, and immersive sounds. As soon as the application loads, a background sound plays continuously, creating an engaging user experience. Additionally, clicking buttons such as "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" triggers sound effects, providing immediate feedback. The encryption process is quick and efficient, allowing users to upload a file, encrypt it with a single click, and automatically download the secured file. The decryption process works similarly, restoring the file to its original form only if the correct encrypted file is provided.

At the core of this tool is Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that handles file uploads, encryption, and decryption. The backend securely processes the files, temporarily storing them in a designated directory before encrypting or decrypting them. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensures a smooth interaction between the user and the backend. JavaScript manages the file selection and sends requests to the Flask server, while CSS animations enhance the futuristic look of the application. The encryption and decryption logic is handled by the AES-256 algorithm, which ensures strong and unbreakable encryption, making the tool ideal for protecting sensitive documents.

To use the tool, the user first selects a file from their local system and uploads it through the web interface. Clicking the "Encrypt" button converts the file into a .aes (AES-encrypted) format, making it unreadable to anyone without the decryption key. The encrypted file is then automatically downloaded to the user's device. When decryption is needed, the user selects the encrypted file and clicks the "Decrypt" button, restoring the file to its original state. The application ensures that only the encrypted file created by the tool can be decrypted, preventing unauthorized access.

This project is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals, businesses, and individuals who want to protect sensitive data such as financial records, personal documents, and business files. Unlike traditional encryption software, this tool is lightweight, web-based, and requires no installation, making it accessible from any device with a browser. With its combination of strong encryption, ease of use, and immersive UI, the Advanced Encryption Tool provides a modern and efficient solution for securing important files.
